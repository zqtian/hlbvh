A fast and efficient CUDA library for building bounding volume hierarchies in real-time, implementing the algorithms described in "HLBVH: Hierarchical LBVH Construction for Real-Time Ray Tracing of Dynamic Geometry, Pantaleoni and Luebke, High Performance Graphics 2010"

**this page is no longer in use:** the above BVH construction code (and much more) is now part of the **[nih](http://code.google.com/p/slash-sandbox/wiki/NIH)** library, located in the [slash-sandbox](http://code.google.com/p/slash-sandbox/) repository.
